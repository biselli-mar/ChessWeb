    <h1>About Chess</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Chess</b> is a classic two-player strategy board game that has been played for
      centuries. It is a game of skill, strategy, and patience, and is enjoyed
      by people of all ages and backgrounds.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>
      The objective of the game is to <i><b>checkmate</b></i> your opponent's king, which
      means putting their king in a position where it is under attack (in
      "<i>check</i>") and there is no way to move it out of attack (in "<i>mate</i>").
    </p>
    <p>
        Each player starts with <b>16 pieces</b>: one king, one queen, two rooks, two
        knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The pieces move in different ways,
        and the player must use strategy to capture their opponent's pieces while
        protecting their own.
