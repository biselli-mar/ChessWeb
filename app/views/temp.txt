        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <span class="about-text">
          The objective of the game is to <i><b>checkmate</b></i> your opponent's king, which
          means putting their king in a position where it is under attack (in
          "<i>check</i>") and there is no way to move it out of attack (in "<i>mate</i>").
        </span>
        <span class="about-text">
            Each player starts with <b>16 pieces</b>: one king, one queen, two rooks, two
            knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The pieces move in different ways,
            and the player must use strategy to capture their opponent's pieces while
            protecting their own.
